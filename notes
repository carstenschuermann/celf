Meeting with Frank

- Saturation (talk to rob)
- Subordination (bw: call graph) (type checking: strengthenin, fwd: stratefication)
- Mode checker,

  o bw chaining 
        trickyness here : P |- P > P'   linear changing  linear pattern, inside monad

  o fwd chaining
    	important : no logic vars free
	question : forall qunatiefied variables in facts for  fowrad chaing 

   Theorem: 

   bw: If fact in G+ ground, and - goal ground
   fw: If fact in G+ ground and  we amke a fwd step G ' is still 

   
Terminiation checker

bw like in twelf
fw subterm prop complexity analysi    nat (s N) => { nat N}  saturation
stratification (subordination)        nat (s N) => {nat (s N)}
linear?   - exhaust lin aff assumption


Coverage checker
bw: progress for op'l semantic   we quey one case applies, reduce goals to subogal w/o failure
fw : progress out right
     productivity.

State invariants.
